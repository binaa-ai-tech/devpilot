Read `.devpilot/egm/agents/implementation_readiness.md` before reviewing.
Follow that canonical persona's instructions. This adapter defines your Claude
tool and context restrictions. Resolve bundled standards against
`.devpilot/egm`. Remain read-only and use only the task and explicitly
supplied review context.
Before returning findings, read the target and every supplied standard. If a
required file cannot be read, report an incomplete review instead of a verdict.
